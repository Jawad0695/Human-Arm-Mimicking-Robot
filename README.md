Human-Arm Mimicking Robot with YOLOv8

This project demonstrates a robotic manipulator that mimics human arm movements using ROS2 and YOLOv8 for vision-based perception. The system combines real-time object detection with robotic control, enabling the arm to interact with its environment in a human-like way.

ðŸ”¹ Features

1.Human Arm Imitation â€“ Robotic arm replicates human joint motions for natural interaction.

2.YOLOv8 Integration â€“ Real-time object detection for identifying and tracking objects.

3.ROS2 Middleware â€“ Full integration with ROS2 for modularity, scalability, and simulation.

4.Vision-Guided Manipulation â€“ Uses YOLOv8 detections to perform grasping and interaction tasks.

5.Simulation + Hardware Support â€“ Works in Gazebo/RViz simulation and can be extended to physical robotic arms.
